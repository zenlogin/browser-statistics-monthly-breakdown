# Browser & User Agent Statistics

This library provides breakdowns of browser (aka user agents or clients)
statistics, specifically focused on browsers during the authentication flow
(e.g. logging into applications).

The statistics are based on Zenlogin API requests, which represent a wide-array
of real-world use cases. This data is intended to be for informational purposes
only.

Breakdowns will feature at most the **top 25** items.
